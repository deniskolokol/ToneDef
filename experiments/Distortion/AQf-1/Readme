A humble try to implement Boss DS-1 distorsion and Ibanez Tubescreamer overdrive pedals following the excellent article "Simplified, physically-informed models of distortion and overdrive guitar effects pedals" by D.T. Yeh and al. (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dtyeh/papers/yeh07_dafx_distortion.pdf).

DistOdrive.pd : lets you immediately try the two pedal simulations.
(lp10_cheb~ is part of iemlib, tested on Pd-extended 0.42.5)

There is a DS-1_tone_stage~-help.pd file, open it.
